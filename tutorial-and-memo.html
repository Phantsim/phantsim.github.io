    <h2 class="feature-header">PROJECT EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <p class="condensed-paragraph">For this project, I had to write a tutorial for anything computer related and then write a memo on how I felt with writing the tutorial and what I was thinking while I was writing it. For the tutorial, I chose how to defend against malware since I believe it's an important skill to have when you have your own PC.</p>
        <p class="condensed-paragraph">For the tutorial, I first started with an introduction on malware, then went on about web surfing practice that helps with reducing the chances of getting malware on your PC, the types of malware, and then how to enhance cybersecurity relating to defensives on the PC itself rather than defensive practices from the user when exploring the web.</p>
        <p class="condensed-paragraph">For the memo, I went into detail how I felt about writing the tutorial, including the genre, content, organization, prose, design elements, illustrations, and file tools. Ultimately, it lead me into wanting to get more technical with the subject due to the audience I assumed for the tutorial.</p>
    <h2 class="feature-header">SKILLS LEARNED</h2>
        <p class="condensed-paragraph">This taught me how to teach people about something indirectly with a text document and how to reflect on what I did for my work. Nowadays, I think I need to do the latter more since reflection helps a lot with improving any skillset and my lack of reflection shows sometimes. However, doing the former more has its uses but it sounds like it gets better when you're practicing a skill intensively rather than just knowing a skill.</p>
