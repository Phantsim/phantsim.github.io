    <h2 class="feature-header">PROJECT EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <p class="condensed-paragraph">For this project, I had to recommend a piece of software based on my evaluation for each one for the type I chose. For this one, I chose word processors since I'm familiar with those types of software. There was a formula to follow for this project, which was introduction, discussion, conclusion, contact, and documentation. So, I complied with it as i did the project. Multiple drafts were allowed too, so I did a rough draft and a final draft.</p>
        <p class="condensed-paragraph">I first introduce the recommedation with the scenario I was provided for this project and the scope of it too. Then, I had three word processors to evaluate. These were Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer, and Google Docs. They were evaulated on three variables: accessibility, reliability, and versatility. Accessibility is how easy it is to get the software and continue using it, reliability is being consistently able to use the software without any disruptions in the workflow, and versatility is the range of the word processor's toolkit.</p>
        <p class="condensed-paragraph">LibreOffice Writer won accessibility and reliability, but there was a three way tie for versatility, since writing aids are more valuable given the scenario. Despite this, LibreOffice Writer was the recommended word processor since it won in two variables.</p>
    <h2 class="feature-header">SKILLS LEARNED</h2>
        <p class="condensed-paragraph">In general, it taught me how to compare and contrast similar programs. Whenever I use another program of the same type, there will be the obvious differences like UI and any major tools that are available. However, I wasn't good at spotting the small stuff like how certain tools behave despite being the same conceptually. Doing this project helped with spotting those small differences when comparing the differences between software toolkits of the same type.</p>
